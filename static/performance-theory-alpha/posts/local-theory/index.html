        <p>Theory is a disconcerted practice for our authors this week. Jon McKenzie’s short summary of the anthropological turn recognizes that theory must dance a line between the general and the local, re-presenting a sense of each in the other:</p>
<p><em>The challenge, then, is not to abandon conceptual modelization, but rather to inscribe this movement within one’s specific situtation to fold generalization back on itself in order to avoid reducing performance to any one model.<br>
                        The Liminal Norm, pp.52.</em></p>
<p>This formulation is, in a sense, good theory. It suspends the explicative imperative by rolling the specifics of the process in question in a simple yet endlessly constructive gesture, namely ‘folding.’ By making this gesture reflexive, a folding of generalization back on itself, the use of theory in the local is painted as a powerfully possibly gesture that somehow resists the shortcomings of its unfolded formulation.</p>
<p>What, though, does generalization folding back on itself actually mean? The formulation is typical of media theory (one of McKenzie’s disciplinary sympathies) in that it is both precise and vague. We can trace the phrase’s grammar without difficulty. ‘Conceptual modelization,’ a tactic of theory at large, ought to be ‘inscribed’ locally so that ‘generalization’ can be reflexivly ‘folded,’ the result being a multivalent model of performance. The air-quoted terms in this phrase, however, are necessarily and intentionally equivocal. Concepts are morphologically hypostatized so that they may be put in syntactic relationship to other concepts, and we are left with a metaphysical pattern, or, to project into three-dimensional space, a constellation, that is repeatably representative of some/many social realities by virtue of its degree of separation from any given reality in question.</p>
<p>Because theory mediates the space between separate entities (conceptual, physical, miscegenated), its project must be conscientious. The Western tradition of theory as it derives from the Greeks, as McKenzie notes, “presupposes a unified for while promising a single, correct answer” in framing its inquiries in the form ‘what is …?’. Both theoretically and pragmatically, anthropology is beleagured by the exacting ghosts/skeletons of colonialism. One cannot construct a general theory without asking for and by whom was it constructed. If a theory mediates a space, then it must also construct a politics of mediation. As Schechner notes, “we need no new educating to the idea that the instruments and means of observing and recording things deeply affect what’s being observed.”</p>
<p>It is no simple matter to construct an ethical theory of interaction, observation, or representation given the century-old ossifications of racialized, gendered, Other-ated aesthetics. How does one begin to think through a set of variegated social realities, let alone represent them in one’s own social realities, let alone wearing the mantle of discipline plaited at an institution punctuated by patriarchal oversight and appropriative productivity? This is the task of the ethnographer.</p>
<p>The first point of procedure in this undertaking for Turner and Schechner is a reflexive methodology that is always partial in its approach to meaning, never total. Turner puts this elegantly:</p>
<p><em>Pure anthropological functionalism, whose aim is to state the conditions of social equilibrium among the components of a social system at a given time, cannot deal with meaning, for meaning always involves retrospection and reflexivity, a past, a history. Meaning is the only category which grasps the full relation of the part to the whole in life, for value, being dominantly affective, belongs essentially to an experience in a conscious present.<br>
                        From Ritual to Theatre, Victor Turner.</em></p>
<p>Theory mediates spaces, and thus a general theory is, in principle, a constellation that has a grammar and vocabulary for every possible space in a site. It seems highly improbable that any thinker, or body/history of thinkers for that matter, might be able to construct an abstraction both capacious and specific enough to do justice to every instance in social reality. The first irremedial problem is language; language speaks, and any one person or scholarly tradition only ever speaks a limited number of languages. There will always be a construction that is glossed, translated, or entirely erased. When we think about languages as not only linguistic systems, but also coporeal, cultural, and other modes of affective construction, any attempt at general theory is overwhelmed by a Brobdingnagian mass of perspectives.</p>
<p>The problematic of general theory is also true of any given local theory. From the perspective of the human mind’s processing power, even a small village’s specific cultural social reality is unfathomably data replete. Knowledge is irremediably perspectival, despite Western theory and linguism’s bad habit for proposing absolutisms.</p>
<p>McKenzie sees Performance Studies, I think, and indeed performance itself, as a mediator in this problematic of theory. Rather than proposing alternative theories that displace and invalidate prior ones (analytic philosophy’s favorite pasttime), performance is “our rehearsal of a general theory.” Moving through Schechner, we know that the rehearsal space is a ‘betwixt and between’ where the subjunctive roams, rather than a rigid space structured by the indicative. (At least, it is this in theory!). McKenzie sees performance theories, ventriloquizing Ronald Grimes through Turner, as “dialectical dancing partners.” They are animated interlocutors that structure and restructure space, each perspectival, partial.</p>
