        <p>Joseph Roach concisely summarizes the key theoretical frame of the method for which Stanislavski is famous:</p>
<p><em>The Stanislavski System is a means of manipulating levels of consciousness to achieve certain specific effects on the body, especially the illusion of spontaneity. It promises to give the actor expressive control over a living organism, his own body, in all its mercurial diversity and surprising obstinancy…. Significantly, the implied division is not between body and mind, but between conscious and unconscious states.
                        The Player’s Passion: Studies in the Sciene of Acting, pp.206.</em></p>
<p>The body and mind (the latter sometimes referred to as the ‘soul’ in our Stanislavski translation) are not ontologically distinct, but rather are moments in the same psychosomatic materiality. Thoughts (mind) and physical reflexes (body) are coterminously subject to the same physics, produced by a dialectic of conscious and unconscious influence. Stanislavskian acting (“our type of art” pp.16, “our type of creativeness” pp.294) is the placement of a symbiotic construction within the topography of the actor’s unconscious, such that conscious mappings (thoughts and reflexes) takes that construction to be a part of the landscape. Though an actor’s performance is governed by the vast contours of the unconscious, the unconscious may be architected obliquely by a sustained conscious directive over time.</p>
<p>Though it is remarkable for the way it confounds classical mind/body dualism, the metaphysical setup of Stanislavski’s actor is not surprising when one considers the theatre as medium. Roach’s suggestion that Stanislavski “sought to create a religion of art, in which the theatre was a temple, the audience worshippers, and the actors celebrants at a mysterious rite” pp.217 approaches this thinking, but one might go further and suggest the mediatic condition of the theatre as an allegorical and essentializing figure for understanding the System’s metaphysical ethics. Representation, not intention, is the ontological currency of the theatre. If something is not staged, it did not happen. Though the ethics of any given play is necessarily couched in codes and customs that carry from beyond the stage’s four walls, the ethics of the theatre-as-medium—that is, what makes a play ‘good’ or ‘bad’ unto itself—is always and only what can be experienced. In the theatre, if it is not on display, it is no good.</p>
<p>Stanislavski’s method calls for the actor to submit himself/herself entirely to the condition of theatre-as-medium. The role that is being played becomes ‘second nature’, and the everyday metaphysical condition (life-as-medium) is subsumed by that of the stage (theatre-as-medium). The changed metaphysical condition of the Stanislavskian actor is suggested throughout An Actor Prepares. It is, as Tortsov tells his pupils, “the state we call ‘I am’”[pp.273]. The state is consistently designated a “truth,” and is demonstratively achieved through the “miraculous metamorphosis”[pp.269] of Kostya in the final chapter. The first person narrator of the text, significantly the subjectivity who mediates the System for us as readers, dives into “the ocean of subconscious”[pp.274], gradually descending through different stages of mingled ontology (“The water is up to his waist now”[pp.274]). The ideal state is paradigmatically represented as the sea, perhaps the most powerful media-imaginary of an unbounded and unboundaried coalescence, in apposition to the territorialized terra firma. The Stanislavskian catharsis is so complete a submersion in the theatre-as-medium that its media politics are indistinguishable from its landlocked precedent: “my part and my own life were so intermingled that they seemed to merge”[pp.275].</p>
<p>As Roach suggests, Stanislavski’s permissive use of rhetorical flourish—“such sonorities as the ‘inner life of the human spirit’ rolled off his tongue far more naturally than technical terms like cerebral reflexes”[pp.217—lends towards a reading of the System as a religious rather than a scientific economy of terms. If his System is a religion, however, it is one with a chary attitude to the spiritual. The System is grounded first and foremost by nature, and only tangentially incorporates the ethereal. The actor must have absolute faith in the conceptual apparatus of the role, so as to wander firmly and confidently on deck the theatre’s ontological floorboards, but must never rely on the mystical intervention of inspiration to inflate the performance’s sails. There is on occasion a mystical sort of pathetic fallacy that punctuates an actor’s sea-faring; but inspiration is fickle Muse, and she “cannot be counted on”[pp.66] for every voyage.</p>

<p>Given that we accept Stanislavski’s actor method in this way, namely as a nautical ethics of representation, I want to experimentally look at its (non)interplay with the technics and method of the modern animation pipeline. Narrative animation, such as that produced by Disney and Pixar, is an art of representation that superficially bears many similarities to the theatrical representation. Of course, it does nothing to misprize the history of criticism regarding medium specifity and claim that animation admits the same ethics as theatre—but neverthess, there is an interesting dialogue between the Stanislavski System for stage and the largely untheorized production methodology for animation. The condition of viewership in animated film still contains something of the ‘unbroken line’ and ‘super-objective’; might his methodology bear something on the many workers of the animation pipeline, the unglamorized collectivity that approximate the ‘actor’ in animation’s hippodrome?</p>
<p>The ‘actor’ in anthropoidal animated films such as Disney’s Moana is no actor at all, but a 3D mesh that has been attributed with various layers, textures and other structured data to represent a character that has representational integrity from all possible perspectives. After this mesh has been constructed, the completion of the ‘modeling’ stage of the animation pipeline that often entails the work of 10s if not 100s of people in a complicated model, the mesh is passed to the ‘rigging’ specialists. Rigging is the process of structuring a virtual skeleton for the model, to restrict the possible spectra of deformations available to the animator, who will be handed the rigged model at the next stage of the pipeline. A sophisticated rigger will make clear the ‘natural’ movements of the character through a series of controls and digital restrictions put in place through the software being used, and will often also provide a ‘control panel’ that details clearly and protologically a character’s range of motion. Next the rigged model is given to the animators, who essentially specify the exact timing the model’s movements in virtual space through a range of techniques, usually engineering motion in accordance with a ‘script’ given by the director. Virtual cameras must also be timed and moved through virtual space to specify the perspective on each model and their virutal environs at any given time, with ‘cuts’ working conceptually in a very similar way to the production of a film using actual cameras and people.</p>
