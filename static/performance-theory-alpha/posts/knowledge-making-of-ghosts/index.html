        <p>      <em>I'll have these players<br>
      Play something like the murder of my father<br>
      Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;<br>
      I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,<br>
      I know my course.<br>
                        Act II, Scene II.</em><br></p>
<p>Hamlet’s staging of The Mousetrap is an attempt to conjure a reaction from Claudius. The pithy end to Hamlet’s rendition of his plot’s purpose, “The play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king,” conceals the intricate reasoning at work in what is arguably the play’s—Hamlet’s, that is—pivotal plot point; the staging of proof that Claudius is a murderous usurper.</p>
<p>The opening scene of Hamlet stages the appearance of a ghost. Marcellus and Bernando, the officers who first see the ghost walking the ramparts of Elsinore, summon their superior Horatio to reckon with the uncanny occurrence that so resembles the late king. They bid him speak to it, recognizing that he is “a scholar.” When the ghost fails to respond, Horatio gives his assessment:</p>
<p>      <em>In what particular thought to work I know not;<br>
      But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br>
      This bodes some strange eruption to our state.<br>
                        Act I, Scene I.</em><br></p>
<p>The state is indeed eventually erupted, all the royal family dying in some way or another by the play’s close. It is not only the political state, however, that flares up and out: the official knowledge-making praxis of courtly Elsinore inflects and implodes. Heralded, even ‘trumpeted,’ by the figure of the ghost, the state is refurbished in new epistemological dress. The body politic has been made volatile by its recently severed head, “the king that was and is the question of these wars,” and it is in such an unsettled state that the structures of officialism that upheld certain norms, traditions and customs (which might previously been [more] robust) collapse.</p>
<p>To be legible is to be ‘clear enough to read,’ and, due to textuality’s enormous influence on our sense of what is legitimate, as per Conquergood, we use the word almost interchangeably with words like ‘understandable’ and ‘interpretable.’ Entwined with this is the preponderance of the visual in our epistemological constitution, as we are undoubtedly captive to one of Conquergood’s “dominant epistemologies that link knowing with seeing.”</p>
<p>Given the role that seeing plays in our knowledge-making, the figure of the ghost represents that which should not be legible to a given epistemological configuration, but nevertheless is. The ghost is a category of phenomenon that blurs the distinction between binaries that cannot be confounded in an imaginary/ideology, such as life and death. By doing so, the ghost exposes the fault lines of a given imaginary. The ghost is phenomenological evidence that a particular imaginary is not wholly sufficient to represent the Real.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s text pays lavish homage to this particular figure of ghost-as-exposê in many ways; perhaps most famously in Hamlet’s oft-quoted: “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” Horatio, the scholar, represents textuality’s grasp on the world. He is confounded when the ghost appears, having no imaginary in which the ghost can mean at all (quotation from top of page). Throughout much of the play, Hamlet functions as a sort of failed Socratic gadfly in this respect. He provokes the court of Elsinore to reconsider their knowledge-making praxis by dialogically exposing their language’s pretensions and presumptions.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s staging of The Mousetrap is designed in light of a fact gleaned from a ghost. The mode of revelation through which Hamlet intends to prove this fact is a reaction to simulated events onstage by a band of players. A blameworthy Claudius, Hamlet assumes, will instinctually react, and crucially react visibly, to the dramatic reenactment of the usurping he has already performed, his complexion triggered by conscience.</p>
<p>In this sense, the play within a play in Hamlet represents a sophisticated rumination on ways of knowing, and in particular the ways in which historical or factual knowing interplay with both ghostly knowing (hauntology) and theatrical knowing (I’m sure there’s a theorist who has a word here, but I might suggest ‘histrionography’). The tension between factual knowing. What is factually known is that which is legible through the dominant modes of knowing in an epistemological frame. The contemporary mode of knowing, both our’s and Shakespeare’s, as I have suggested through Conquergood, is characterized by its textual and visual strands—though admittedly Shakespeare’s relationship to verbal/aural knowing is likely quite different than our own ratiocinative, data-driven thinking, given the 16th century’s antediluvian landscapes of literacy and technological medium.</p>
<p>In addition to its readability in the official death toll of the state, the eruption of the Denmark state is also performantly (invoking Diana Taylor and her preference for this term over the already-canonized ‘performative’) inscribed in the dialogic contours of Hamlet’s “crafty madness.” Through a combination of his already-legible status as prince and artful ingenuity, Hamlet serves as an attorney for those subjugated modes of knowledge, hauntology and historionography, in Elsinore’s court. This advocacy is spelled out in Hamlet’s reflections immediately after his first encounter with the ghost:</p>
<p>      <em>Yea, from the table of my memory<br>
      I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br>
      All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br>
      That youth and observation copied there;<br>
      And thy commandment all alone shall live<br>
      Within the book and volume of my brain,<br>
      Unmix’d with baser matter: yes, by heaven!<br>
                        Act I, Scene V.</em><br></p>
<p>Hamlet unravels the state by putting pressure on those of its epistemological tendencies that do not hold up to phenomenological scrutiny, by playing the protagonist who gives weight to the words of ghosts. He becomes cognizant of the mnemonic erasures that the archive purports, and tunes his knowledge-making to do justice to what he sees as effaced. His characted is not staged, however, entirely as an embodiment of Diana Taylor’s repertoire, those mnemonic practices that belie the archive. He is more of an epistemlogical imp, a messenger between ghosts and offical bodies that mischeviously meddles with expected corollaries to their eventual implosion. Hamlet does not destroy the letter that orders his execution; he rewrites it to condemn Rosencrantz and Guildernstern (the existential happening that inspires Tom Stoppard’s famous play).</p>
<p>To return, on this note, to the figure of a play within a play: Shakespeare’s attention to the intricate epistemological theatre of his own knowledge-making practice Is iterated throughout Hamlet, but The Mousetrap is perhaps its most concisely performed profile. Ingeniously, Shakespeare inductively legitimates theatre-as-medium by staging the play as the pivot through which hauntology influences the dominant modes of knowledge. Claudius’ reaction is that of one who, retreating to the comfort of familiar optic sensibility, will not bear witness to ghosts: “Give me some light, away!” The courtly (Greek) chorus emphatically echoes his sentiment triadically, a performative call that bids all leave but those who have seen and believed a ghost earlier in the play, Hamlet and Horatio.</p>
