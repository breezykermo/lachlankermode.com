Originally from Auckland, New Zealand, I'm a full stack developer, particularly interested in frontend functional JavaScript via React & React Native. Co-founder at [DirectDrinks](https://directdrinks.com.au/), I'm currently completing my studies in Computer Science at Princeton University. See [my resume](/resume) for more about how I develop. See some of my [field notes](/) for the thoughts I have tried to code in writing.

I keep this website as a practice, not as a product. If you have comments, suggestions, or any other form of feedback, please feel free to [email me](mailto:lachlankermode@live.com).
