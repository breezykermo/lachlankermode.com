The following film is an investigation and representation of Trinh T. Min-ha's argument in her 1990 essay, "[Documentary Is/Not a Name](https://www.jstor.org/stable/778886?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)". It is also a self-conscious experiment in visual criticism, or theory. The short film could now be a sort of essay, as moving pictures have an infrastructural availability in digital distribution that before they were not afforded.
